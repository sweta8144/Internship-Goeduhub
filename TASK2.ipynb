        "\n",
        "Ans: The primary difference between the list sort() function and the sorted() function is that the sort() function will modify the list it is called on. The sorted() function will create a new list containing a sorted version of the list it is given. The sorted() function will not modify the list passed as a parameter.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, we use =operator to create a copy of an object. It doesn't create a new object. It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the original object. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements. If we make changes to any nested objects in original object old_list, we’ll see no changes to the copy new_list.\n",

        "Ans: The task of flattening can also be performed by using built-in functions that Python offers i.e sum(). The function has two parameters:”iterable” which is a list of lists and “start” which is an empty list that serves as the initial flat list to which items of the inner sublists are added.\n",

Typecasting to set can be done by simply using set(list_name).To convert a list to a dictionary, we can use list comprehension and make a key:value pair of consecutive elements. Finally, type case the list to dict type\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Python has a built-in function called filter() that allows you to filter a list in a more beautiful way. The filter() function iterates over the elements of the list and applies the fn() function to each element. It returns an iterator for the elements where the fn() returns True.\n",
